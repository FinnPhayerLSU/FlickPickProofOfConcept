# FlickPickProofOfConcept
Hey guys, so this is something I've been working on this evening. It's really bare bones, but it kind of works. I wanted to set this up in the shared repository, but I don't think I have permission to make a GitHub pages website on there. 

So for starters, there are only 40 movies in the "database," so options are quite limited in terms of what it suggests.

If you right click, click inspect, then click console on the top left, you can see what movies were inputted.

If you wanna mess around with that, I think you should be able to download the code from my repository, and then the moviespreadsheet excel file has all of the possible movies, and suggestions has the movies the user would input. If you change the files, then reupload them to your own github page, you should get new results.

Also since the code is pretty rough there probably a whole bunch of bugs, and there is nothing catching errors right now, so the suggested movies can't have capitilization errors 
or spelling errors.

And just to get something that works, the algorithm it uses to pick the movie is super simple, and it can also pick one of the movies you input.
